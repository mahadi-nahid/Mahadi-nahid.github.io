I am a graduate student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), Canada, under the supervision of Professor [Davood Rafiei](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the AI and Database Lab, where I actively contribute to cutting-edge research initiatives.

My research interests span across Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Large Language Models. I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches to enhance language understanding and retrieval systems.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from [Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)](https://www.sust.edu), Bangladesh.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research projects, publications, and academic journey.
