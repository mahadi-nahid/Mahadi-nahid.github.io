I am a graduate student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, Canada, under the supervision of Professor Davood Rafiei. Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the AI and Database Lab, where I actively contribute to cutting-edge research initiatives.

My research interests span across Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Large Language Models. I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches to enhance language understanding and retrieval systems.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research projects, publications, and academic journey.
